```{{sidebar}} More contributions
Additional Evennia code snippets and contributions can be found
in the [Community Contribs & Snippets][forum] forum.
```
_Contribs_ are optional code snippets and systems contributed by
the Evennia community. They vary in size and complexity and
may be more specific about game types and styles than 'core' Evennia.
This page is auto-generated and summarizes all **{ncontribs}** contribs currently included
with the Evennia distribution.

All contrib categories are imported from `evennia.contrib`, such as

    from evennia.contrib.base_systems import building_menu

Each contrib contains installation instructions for how to integrate it
with your other code. If you want to tweak the code of a contrib, just
copy its entire folder to your game directory and modify/use it from there.

If you want to add a contrib, see [the contrib guidelines](Contribs-Guidelines)!
