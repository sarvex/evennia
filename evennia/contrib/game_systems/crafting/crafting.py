Crafting - Griatch 2020

This is a general crafting engine. The basic functionality of crafting is to
combine any number of of items or tools in a 'recipe' to produce a new result.

    item + item + item + tool + tool  -> recipe -> new result

This is useful not only for traditional crafting but the engine is flexible
enough to also be useful for puzzles or similar.

## Installation

- Add the `CmdCraft` Command from this module to your default cmdset. This
  allows for crafting from in-game using a simple syntax.
- Create a new module and add it to a new list in your settings file
  (`server/conf/settings.py`) named `CRAFT_RECIPES_MODULES`, such as
  `CRAFT_RECIPE_MODULES = ["world.recipes_weapons"]`.
- In the new module(s), create one or more classes, each a child of
  `CraftingRecipe` from this module. Each such class must have a unique `.name`
  property. It also defines what inputs are required and what is created using
  this recipe.
- Objects to use for crafting should (by default) be tagged with tags using the
  tag-category `crafting_material` or `crafting_tool`. The name of the object
  doesn't matter, only its tag.

## Crafting in game

The default `craft` command handles all crafting needs.
::

    > craft spiked club from club, nails

Here, `spiked club` specifies the recipe while `club` and `nails` are objects
the crafter must have in their inventory. These will be consumed during
crafting (by default only if crafting was successful).

A recipe can also require *tools* (like the `hammer` above). These must be
either in inventory *or* be in the current location. Tools are *not* consumed
during the crafting process.
::

    > craft wooden doll from wood with knife

## Crafting in code

In code, you should use the helper function `craft` from this module. This
specifies the name of the recipe to use and expects all suitable
ingredients/tools as arguments (consumables and tools should be added together,
tools will be identified before consumables).

```python

    from evennia.contrib.game_systems.crafting import crafting

    spiked_club = crafting.craft(crafter, "spiked club", club, nails)

```

The result is always a list with zero or more objects. A fail leads to an empty
list. The crafter should already have been notified of any error in this case
(this should be handle by the recipe itself).

## Recipes

A *recipe* is a class that works like an input/output blackbox: you initialize
it with consumables (and/or tools) if they match the recipe, a new
result is spit out.  Consumables are consumed in the process while tools are not.

This module contains a base class for making new ingredient types
(`CraftingRecipeBase`) and an implementation of the most common form of
crafting (`CraftingRecipe`) using objects and prototypes.

Recipes are put in one or more modules added as a list to the
`CRAFT_RECIPE_MODULES` setting, for example:

```python

    CRAFT_RECIPE_MODULES = ['world.recipes_weapons', 'world.recipes_potions']

```

Below is an example of a crafting recipe and how `craft` calls it under the
hood. See the `CraftingRecipe` class for details of which properties and
methods are available to override - the craft behavior can be modified
substantially this way.

```python

    from evennia.contrib.game_systems.crafting.crafting import CraftingRecipe

    class PigIronRecipe(CraftingRecipe):
        # Pig iron is a high-carbon result of melting iron in a blast furnace.

        name = "pig iron"  # this is what crafting.craft and CmdCraft uses
        tool_tags = ["blast furnace"]
        consumable_tags = ["iron ore", "coal", "coal"]
        output_prototypes = [
            {"key": "Pig Iron ingot",
             "desc": "An ingot of crude pig iron.",
             "tags": [("pig iron", "crafting_material")]}
        ]

    # for testing, conveniently spawn all we need based on the tags on the class
    tools, consumables = PigIronRecipe.seed()

    recipe = PigIronRecipe(caller, *(tools + consumables))
    result = recipe.craft()

```

If the above class was added to a module in `CRAFT_RECIPE_MODULES`, it could be
called using its `.name` property, as "pig iron".

The [example_recipies](api:evennia.contrib.game_systems.crafting.example_recipes) module has
a full example of the components for creating a sword from base components.

    The CraftRecipe implements the most common form of crafting: Combining (and
    consuming) inputs to produce a new result. This type of recipe only works
    with typeclassed entities as inputs and outputs, since it's based on Tags
    and Prototypes.

    There are two types of crafting ingredients: 'tools' and 'consumables'. The
    difference between them is that the former is not consumed in the crafting
    process. So if you need a hammer and anvil to craft a sword, they are
    'tools' whereas the materials of the sword are 'consumables'.

    Examples:
    ::

        class FlourRecipe(CraftRecipe):
            name = "flour"
            tool_tags = ['windmill']
            consumable_tags = ["wheat"]

                {"key": "Bag of flour",
                 "typeclass": "typeclasses.food.Flour",
                 "desc": "A small bag of flour."
                 "tags": [("flour", "crafting_material")],

            output_prototypes = [
                {"key": "bread",
                 "desc": "A tasty bread."
                }
            ]


    ## Properties on the class level:

    - `name` (str): The name of this recipe. This should be globally unique.

    ### tools

    - `tool_tag_category` (str): What tag-category tools must use. Default is
      'crafting_tool'.
    - `tool_tags` (list): Object-tags to use for tooling. If more than one instace
      of a tool is needed, add multiple entries here.
    - `tool_names` (list): Human-readable names for tools. These are used for informative
      messages/errors. If not given, the tags will be used. If given, this list should
      match the length of `tool_tags`.:
    - `exact_tools` (bool, default True): Must have exactly the right tools, any extra
      leads to failure.
    - `exact_tool_order` (bool, default False): Tools must be added in exactly the
      right order for crafting to pass.

    ### consumables

    - `consumable_tag_category` (str): What tag-category consumables must use.
      Default is 'crafting_material'.
    - `consumable_tags` (list): Tags for objects that will be consumed as part of
      running the recipe.
    - `consumable_names` (list): Human-readable names for consumables. Same as for tools.
    - `exact_consumables` (bool, default True): Normally, adding more consumables
      than needed leads to a a crafting error. If this is False, the craft will
      still succeed (only the needed ingredients will be consumed).
    - `exact_consumable_order` (bool, default False): Normally, the order in which
      ingredients are added does not matter. With this set, trying to add consumables in
      another order than given will lead to failing crafting.
    - `consume_on_fail` (bool, default False): Normally, consumables remain if
      crafting fails. With this flag, a failed crafting will still consume
      consumables. Note that this will also consume any 'extra' consumables
      added not part of the recipe!

    ### outputs (result of crafting)

    - `output_prototypes` (list): One or more prototypes (`prototype_keys` or
      full dicts) describing how to create the result(s) of this recipe.
    - `output_names` (list): Human-readable names for (prospective) prototypes.
      This is used in error messages. If not given, this is extracted from the
      prototypes' `key` if possible.

    ### custom error messages

    custom messages all have custom formatting markers. Many are empty strings
    when not applicable.
    ::

        {missing}: Comma-separated list of tool/consumable missing for missing/out of order errors.
        {excess}: Comma-separated list of tool/consumable added in excess of recipe
        {inputs}: Comma-separated list of any inputs (tools + consumables) involved in error.
        {tools}: Comma-sepatated list of tools involved in error.
        {consumables}: Comma-separated list of consumables involved in error.
        {outputs}: Comma-separated list of (expected) outputs
        {t0}..{tN-1}: Individual tools, same order as `.tool_names`.
        {c0}..{cN-1}: Individual consumables, same order as `.consumable_names`.
        {o0}..{oN-1}: Individual outputs, same order as `.output_names`.

    - `error_tool_missing_message`: "Could not craft {outputs} without {missing}."
    - `error_tool_order_message`:
      "Could not craft {outputs} since {missing} was added in the wrong order."
    - `error_tool_excess_message`: "Could not craft {outputs} (extra {excess})."
    - `error_consumable_missing_message`: "Could not craft {outputs} without {missing}."
    - `error_consumable_order_message`:
      "Could not craft {outputs} since {missing} was added in the wrong order."
    - `error_consumable_excess_message`: "Could not craft {outputs} (excess {excess})."
    - `success_message`: "You successfuly craft {outputs}!"
    - `failure_message`: ""  (this is handled by the other error messages by default)

    ## Hooks

    1. Crafting starts by calling `.craft(**kwargs)` on the parent class. The
       `**kwargs` are optional, extends any `**kwargs` passed to the class
       constructor and will be passed into all the following hooks.
    3. `.pre_craft(**kwargs)` should handle validation of inputs. Results should
       be stored in `validated_consumables/tools` respectively. Raises `CraftingValidationError`
       otherwise.
    4. `.do_craft(**kwargs)` will not be called if validation failed. Should return
       a list of the things crafted.
    5. `.post_craft(crafting_result, **kwargs)` is always called, also if validation
       failed (`crafting_result` will then be falsy). It does any cleanup. By default
       this deletes consumables.

    Use `.msg` to conveniently send messages to the crafter. Raise
    `evennia.contrib.game_systems.crafting.crafting.CraftingError` exception to abort
    crafting at any time in the sequence. If raising with a text, this will be
    shown to the crafter automatically
