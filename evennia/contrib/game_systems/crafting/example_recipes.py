How to make a sword - example crafting tree for the crafting system.

See the `SwordSmithingBaseRecipe` in this module for an example of extendng the
recipe with a mocked 'skill' system (just random chance in our case). The skill
system used is game-specific but likely to be needed for most 'real' crafting
systems.

Note that 'tools' are references to the tools used - they don't need to be in
the inventory of the crafter. So when 'blast furnace' is given below, it is a
reference to a blast furnace used, not suggesting the crafter is carrying it
around with them.

## Sword crafting tree

::

    # base materials (consumables)

    iron ore, ash, sand, coal, oak wood, water, fur

    # base tools (marked with [T] for clarity and assumed to already exist)

    blast furnace[T], furnace[T], crucible[T], anvil[T],
    hammer[T], knife[T], cauldron[T]

    # recipes for making a sword

    pig iron = iron ore + 2xcoal + blast furnace[T]
    crucible_steel = pig iron + ash + sand + 2xcoal + crucible[T]
    sword blade = crucible steel + hammer[T] + anvil[T] + furnace[T]
    sword pommel = crucible steel + hammer[T] + anvil[T] + furnace[T]
    sword guard = crucible steel + hammer[T] + anvil[T] + furnace[T]

    rawhide = fur + knife[T]
    oak bark + cleaned oak wood = oak wood + knife[T]
    leather = rawhide + oak bark + water + cauldron[T]

    sword handle = cleaned oak wood + knife[T]

    sword = sword blade + sword guard + sword pommel
            + sword handle + leather + knife[T] + hammer[T] + furnace[T]


## Recipes used for spell casting

This is a simple example modifying the base Recipe to use as a way
to describe magical spells instead. It combines tools with
a skill (an attribute on the caster) in order to produce a magical effect.

The example `CmdCast` command can be added to the CharacterCmdset in
`mygame/commands/default_cmdsets` to test it out. The 'effects' are
just mocked for the example.

::
    # base tools (assumed to already exist)

    spellbook[T], wand[T]

    # skill (stored as Attribute on caster)

    firemagic skill level10+

    # recipe for fireball

    fireball = spellbook[T] + wand[T] + [firemagic skill lvl10+]
